# Dev intial setup

## System requirements

First, make sure you have the following installed

 - Node
 - npm (Node package manager)
 - pnpm (can be installed with npm)
 - git (for version control through the terminal)

## Getting the files & running the dev environment

In your terminal, create a folder to store the project:
(These are BASH commands, which are native on a Mac or Linux system)

1. Make a folder and navigate to it `mkdir ~/dev/electricpotential && cd ~/dev/electricpotential`

2. Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:electricpotential/electricpotential.org.git`

3. Run the web app `cd web && pnpm i && pnpm dev``

Now you can view your app as you develop on http://localhost:3000

## Recommended environment

Feel free to use whatever, but these are essential tools for my workflow

 - Visual Studio Code (IMPORTANT: This is DIFFERENT from Visual Studio)
   - Extensions: GitLens, Prettier, ESLint, TailwindCSS Intellisense
 - Iterm 2 (rather than using the regular terminal)
